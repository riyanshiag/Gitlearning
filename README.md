*Duration: 03/07/2023 - 15/12/2023*

## Overview
As a Software Development Intern at Amazon Development Centre Bangalore, I played a key role in re-architecturing the team's integration tests package and contributing to various aspects of the project.

## Responsibilities and Achievements

1. **Re-architecture of Integration Tests Package**
   - Deployed a configuration-driven approach to reduce code redundancy.
   - Established a modular design for testing the teamâ€™s systems in integration.
   - The mechanism served as a template for over 5 teams within the organization.

2. **Configuration Management with JSONNET**
   - Created flow-wise default configs and test-specific Test Data configs.
   - Written in JSONNET language for easy addition of new attributes and test cases.
   - Served as an alternative to the config-map merging logic.

3. **Third-Party Clone of Sjsonnet**
   - Created a third-party clone to Amazon internal code base of an external Scala package called Sjsonnet.
   - Authored a custom build file and conducted deep-dive research, providing a JSONnet templating framework for over 250 teams at Amazon.

4. **Deserialization with GSON Library**
   - Implemented deserializers using GSON library for encoding input and output Test Data.
   - Generated SQS notifications for integration testing.
   - Optimized memory efficiency in base functions by adapting a config-based mechanism for calling integration tests.

5. **Code Quality and Reusability**
   - Enhanced code quality by refactoring existing Message Encoding logic.
   - Utilized Object-oriented principles such as interfaces, generic classes, and method overloading.
   - Opted for a non-hierarchical design in config architecture, reducing inter-test dependencies.

6. **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Practices**
   - Executed Test-Driven Development practices, including unit and integration tests in Java.

7. **Tools and Technologies**
   - Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), JSON, JSONnet, Scala, Git, GSON, AWS-Lambda, and SQS.
